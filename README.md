Flying
======

This is an experiment of mine from a number of years ago, the aim of
which was to recreate in HTML5 the classic Flying Windows and
Starfield Simulation screensavers from Microsoft Windows.

The code is rather excessively generic, but not very well-written --
it would be much better if it were object-oriented.

This demo incorporates graphics and fonts from Microsoft Windows,
which are copyright and/or trademark of Microsoft.
